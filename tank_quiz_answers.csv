ussr_kv_2,KV-2,HT,"Peek-A-Boo, Hit & Run, Circle Of Death, 1 vs 1 brawl.","A heavy 52 ton assault tank with the M-10 152 mm howitzer, the KV-2 was produced at the same time as the KV-1. Due to the size of its heavy turret and gun, the KV-2 was slower and had a much higher profile than the KV-1. Those captured and used by the German Army were known as (Sturm)Panzerkampfwagen KW-II 754(r)."
usa_m4a3e8,M4A3E8,MT,"Peek-A-Boo, Long range sniping, Circle Of Death.","From May to July 1944, the Army accepted a limited run of 254 M4A3E2 ""Jumbo"" Shermans, which had very thick hull armor and the 75 mm gun in a new, better-protected T23-style turret (""Jumbos"" could mount the 76 mm M1 cannon), to assault fortifications, leading convoys, and spearhead armored columns. The M4A3 model was the first to be factory-produced with the HVSS system with wider tracks to distribute weight, beginning in August 1944. With the smooth ride of the HVSS, it gained the nickname ""Easy Eight"" from its experimental ""E8"" designation."
ussr_is_3,IS-3,HT,Long range sniping.,"The IS-3 (also known as Object 703) is a Soviet heavy tank developed in late 1944. Its semi-hemispherical cast turret (resembling that of an upturned soup bowl) became the hallmark of post-war Soviet tanks. Its pike nose design would also be mirrored by other tanks of the IS tank family such as the IS-7 and T-10. Produced too late to see combat in World War II, the IS-3 participated in the Berlin Victory Parade of 1945, the Soviet invasion of Hungary, the Six-Day War, Yom Kippur War, and one was used during the early stages of the Russo-Ukrainian War."

Developed in an era when HEAT warheads were thought to make conventional heavy armour of limited value, the Leopard design focused on effective firepower and mobility instead of heavy protection."
